R files analyzing long-term wind and cyanobacterial data from Lake Mendota. 
Analyses include: 
Calculation of estimated wave height and periods from wind direction and speed data
Calculation of wind event duration at various wind speed thresholds
Comparison of daily averages of wave height and phycocyanin (a proxy of cyanobacterial abundance)
Analysis of cyanobacteria sizes
Plots of these analyses
