**R files analyzing long-term wind and cyanobacterial data from Lake
Mendota.**

Analyses include:

-   Calculation of estimated wave height and periods from wind direction
    and speed data

-   Calculation of wind event duration at various wind speed thresholds

-   Comparison of daytime averages of wave height and phycocyanin (a
    proxy of cyanobacterial abundance)

-   Analysis of cyanobacteria sizes

-   Plots of these analyses
